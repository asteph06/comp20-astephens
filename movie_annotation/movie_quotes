Igor: DR. FRANKENSTEIN?!?!?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Frokensteen.
Igor: You're putting me on.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: No, it pronounced, "Frokensteen".
Igor: Do you also say Froaderick?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: No . . . "Frederick."
Igor: Well, why isn't it 'Froaderick Frokensteen'?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: It isn't, it's "Frederick Frokensteen"
Igor: I see.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: You must be Igor. [He pronounces it ee-gor.]
Igor: No, it's pronounced "eye-gor."
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: But they told me it was "ee-gor"...
Igor: Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Uh, you were sent here by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Igor: Yes. My grandfather used to work for your grandfather.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: How nice.
Igor: Of course the rates have gone up.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Of course, of course, I'm sure we'll get along splendidly. Oh, I uh, you know I don't mean to embarrass you, but I'm rather a brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Igor: What hump
