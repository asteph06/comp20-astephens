			 	Introduction
			 </h3>
			 <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
			 	The website being tested is a small web application designed to
			 	run the game 2048, and store the scores on a server which uses 
			 	a database run through mongodb. The goal here is break the web
			 	server as much as possible in order to discover any security 
			 	flaws the system may have.
			 </p>
		 </div>
		 <div class="Methodology">
			 <h3>
			 	Methodology
			 </h3>
			 <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
			 	At first the server was sent scores by impossible names that 
			 	would not usually be sent through the use of curl. Upon 
			 	discovering that html code could be inserted into the scores
			 	page, this fact was taken advantage of by inserting malicious
			 	scripts into the page that sent additional information to the 
			 	server repeatedly.

			 	Additionally, the scores.json page was requested for various 
			 	different usernames in an attempt to get more data than should
			 	be available. by using the query string " /?username[$qt]= " 
			 	I was able to recieve all user's information.
			 </p>
		 </div>
		 <div class="Abstract">
			 <h3>
			 	Abstract Findings
			 </h3>
			 <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
			 	The biggest vulnerability in this application exists in the 
			 	ability to post usernames to be displayed on the score board 
			 	that may contain html scripts with malicious content. 
			 </p>
		 </div> 
		 <div class="Issues">
			 <h3>
			 	Issues Found
			 </h3>
			 <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
			 	The largest issue is in the lack of checking for script elements
			 	(or any element) in the acceptance and printing of the username or
			 	score to the score screen. This allows a potential hacker to bypass
			 	the same origin resource policy and to use the server to distribute
			 	information about the server as well as other users of the website.

			 	By inserting a javascript element that can send information to 
			 	a hacker owned server, this website can easily host macicious content
			 	that can damage user's privacy by sending their location somewhere
			 	unwanted.

			 	What's more, the server already has access to a module that 
			 	has the ability to check for patterns in JSON strings - jsonschema.
			 	This code should be written here:
			 	<p></p>
			 	<img src="error_code_validation.png" alt="overly passable validator" height="100%" width="100%">
			 	<p></p>
			 	As well, the security on ouput of the html is lacking. Should someone
			 	want to use a username that could be intertpreted as a script, the
			 	output html should be inserted such that all "<" and ">" characters
			 	no longer insert elements:
			 	<p></p>
				<img src="error_code.png" alt="non-checking html output" height="100%" width="100%">
			 </p>
			 	<p></p>
			 	 Not only does this leave open the sending of private user data
			 	 to malicious servers, but it enables the shutdown of the mongoDB
			 	 servers with the use of repeated posting scripts written in the 
			 	 inserted scripts. After posting thousands of json files to the
			 	 server, I was able to overwhelm it a small script designed to sent many
			 	 small pieces of data to the server. The following result occurs: 
			 	 (no usernames, scores, or dates are shown).
				<p></p>
				<img src="overloaded_server.png" alt="overloaded server scores page" height="50%" width="50%">
			 	<p></p>
			 	The last and possibly worst security issue in this website is the
			 	ability to recieve all information housed in the database with the
			 	query string /?username[$gt]= . In my case since the server has been
			 	overloaded with information, the request times out and gives a website
			 	error. But the fact the error is shown gives an indication of what is 
			 	going on: the server is trying to access too many scores.

			 	<p><b>issue:</b> can insert non integer values as scores. Found in the
			 	server post method. <b>Severity:</b> low. Resolved with simple checks</p>

			 	<p><b>issue:</b> can insert html scripts into the scores page. Found in 
			 	the server get method for returning the base URL. <b>Severity:</b> high.
			 	Resolved with greater checks on the get request or on the post
			 	 request for html elements </p>
			 	<p>
			 		
			 	<p><b>issue:</b> can recieve all usernames and scores from
			 	the server using the query "/?username[$qt]=". Found 
			 	in the get request for scores.json.<b>Severity:</b>high. Resolved
				by checking query content type for string.</p>

			 <h3>
			 	Conclusion
			 </h3>
			 <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
			 	Recommendations:
			 	<p style="padding-left: 20px;">
			 		use jsonschema node module to check for html scripts and 
			 		integer values for the score.
			 	</p>
			 	<p style="padding-left: 20px;">
			 		check usernames before outputting them to html.
			 	</p>
			 	<p style="padding-left: 20px;">
			 		check for objects in the username query
			 	</p>
